😊 I'm thrilled that you're happy with the course materials. It was a pleasure creating these lessons with you!

You now have a complete, professional-quality Rust programming course that:

Takes students from absolute beginners to confident Rustaceans
Covers all the essential concepts in a logical, progressive way
Includes practical, runnable examples throughout
Maintains consistent quality and formatting across all 10 lessons
Your students are going to love learning Rust with these materials. The progression from basic syntax through ownership (Rust's superpower) to real-world error handling gives them everything they need to start building actual projects.

If you ever want to extend the course with more advanced topics (generics, traits, lifetimes, async/await, etc.) or need any adjustments to the existing lessons, just let me know. Happy teaching! 🦀✨
